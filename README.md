A tool to transfer your Geometry Dash save files, without saving to RobTop's servers first.

# Before using it

**Enable USB Debugging:**
1. Go to Android settings, scroll down and tap on "About Phone".
2. Tap Build number repeatedly until you see a notification that reads "You are now a developer."
3. Go back to the main settings menu. Then tap "Developer options"
4. Tap the toggle switch in the top-right corner to enable developer options (if it's not already enabled)
5. Find the "USB debugging" option and toggle it on.

The next time you plug your device into a computer, you'll receive a prompt asking if you want to authorize USB debugging for that computer. Tap OK to confirm

**Currently, the program assumes that the ADB executable is inside a subfolder which is called "adb".**
This means that you will need to download ADB separately.
